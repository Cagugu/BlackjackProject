# BlackjackProject


##Overview:
The BlackjackProject is an in-depth, and largely variable project to develop. This required 10 classes in order to run. It is a perfect glimpse at what OOP is.

##Challenges:
For me, this was the toughest project yet. Not only did I go into it with zero knowledge of the game of blackjack, but I also found it hard to translate that (non-existent) idea of blackjack into a program. I had a really hard time understanding how to make all of the pieces interact as they do in real life.

##TakeAways:
My largest takeaways from this project was thinking about how things interact in the real world and translating that into a programable idea. I realized I need to look at things more generally instead of the over-thinky way I do now. I need to take objects and their purpose or parts at face value so I can more easily translate them into a program. Over all I enjoyed this project, but definitely feel kicked back to a pit on the metaphorical roller coaster.
